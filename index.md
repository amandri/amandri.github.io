## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/).

My research lies at the intersection of econometrics, time series and financial econometrics.

My main supervisor is [Eric Renault](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/emrrenault/#). My second main supervisor is [Cesare Robotti](https://www.cesarerobotti.com).

Abstract: \
*We study the size and power properties of t-tests of parameter restrictions for newly- designed methods that aim at reliably estimating risk premia in linear asset pricing models when the cross-sectional dimension is large. By simulating a variety of empirically calibrated data generating processes for sample sizes that are typically en- countered in empirical work, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the test statistics for scenarios where the factor structure is (i) strong and pervasive; (ii) spurious; (iii) weak/semi-strong and pervasive; (iv) weak/semi-strong and not pervasive; and (v) sparse. PCA-based methods such as those of Lettau and Pelger (2020), Giglio and Xiu (2021), and Giglio et al. (2022) work best when the factors are strong and pervasive, and they continue to exhibit good finite-sample properties when the factors are spurious. However, when the factor structure is semi-strong and pervasive, the split-sample estimator of Anatolyev and Mikusheva (2021) performs substantially better than the PCA-based estimators listed above. In the case of sparse loadings or when the factors are semi-strong and not pervasive, none of the candidate methods displays satisfactory finite-sample properties.*

Abstract: \
*To explain the cross-section of asset returns, a “zoo” of economic factors that are not portfolios (nontradables) have been proposed. Due to their small correlation with the asset returns, risk premia inference tends to be fragile, and the issue of weak identification might be exacerbated by the degree of model misspecification. Yet, robust inference has often been overlooked in many empirical works, and limited efforts have been devoted to “domesticate” such factors. With respect to the most commonly used asset returns, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive re-examination of the non-traded factor zoo published in top academic journals, with a focus on the aforementioned fragilities. We confirm that the vast majority of the original model specifications suffer such problems, and robust inference leads to strong evidences that most of the proposed nontraded factors are unpriced. The findings are more drastic when considering additional traded factors as controls. When considering the entirety of the nontradables, we conclude however that the zoo carries some nonzero pricing ability.*
