## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/) 

My research lies at the intersection of econometrics, time series and financial econometrics.

My main supervisor is [Eric Renault](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/emrrenault/#). My second main supervisor is [Cesare Robotti](https://www.cesarerobotti.com).

Abstract: \
*We study the size and power properties of t-tests of parameter restrictions for newly- designed methods that aim at reliably estimating risk premia in linear asset pricing models when the cross-sectional dimension is large. By simulating a variety of empirically calibrated data generating processes for sample sizes that are typically en- countered in empirical work, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the test statistics for scenarios where the factor structure is (i) strong and pervasive; (ii) spurious; (iii) weak/semi-strong and pervasive; (iv) weak/semi-strong and not pervasive; and (v) sparse. PCA-based methods such as those of Lettau and Pelger (2020), Giglio and Xiu (2021), and Giglio et al. (2022) work best when the factors are strong and pervasive, and they continue to exhibit good finite-sample properties when the factors are spurious. However, when the factor structure is semi-strong and pervasive, the split-sample estimator of Anatolyev and Mikusheva (2021) performs substantially better than the PCA-based estimators listed above. In the case of sparse loadings or when the factors are semi-strong and not pervasive, none of the candidate methods displays satisfactory finite-sample properties.*

Abstract: \
*To explain the cross-section of asset returns, a “zoo” of economic factors which are not
portfolios have been proposed. Since these tend to have minor correlation with the as-
set returns, the inference is more prone to suffer the issues of model misspecification
and/or weak identification/spuriousness. Yet, robust inference on the risk premia has
often been overlooked and limited efforts have been devoted to “domesticate” such
factors. With respect to the most commonly used asset returns, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive re-examination of the non-traded factor zoo published in top
academic journals. We confirm that the vast majority of the original model specifications suffer the aforementioned problems. This motivates to conduct robust risk premia inference, that leads to strong evidence that most of the original nontradables are
indeed unpriced. The findings are more drastic when we study the single-nontradable
model and control for popular traded factors.*\
